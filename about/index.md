I am Matthew Peters, currently the Director of Data Science at
[Moz](https://moz.com).  I am the tech lead and manager of the team
that owns our machine learning systems, all the way from prototype
to production.

Some of the projects I have lead at Moz include:

* Page Authority and Domain Authority - these are machine learning ranking
models we use to score 200+ billion URLs every month.
* Algorithmic web spam detection.  I designed and implemented a big data system that crawls 500+ million sub-domains each month and tags them with a spam score.
* Customer segmentation and scoring to inform internal marketing efforts.
[Recently we have had success using a recurrent neural network to model customer lifecycles.](/deep-learning-for-customer-churn-prediction/)
* [Dragnet, an state of the art webpage de-chroming algorithm](/benchmarking-python-content-extraction-algorithms-dragnet-readability-goose-and-eatiht/)
* State of the art keyword extraction algorithms from web pages
* Web page author detection
* [RSS feed ranking](http://matt-peters.github.io/a-look-under-the-hood-of-feed-authority/)

I have Ph.D. in Applied Math from the University of Washington.
